# Lung-Disease-XAI

#### This project focuses on Explainable AI (XAI) for lung disease prediction using machine learning models.
#### It highlights model predictions along with interpretability techniques to understand decision-making.

## Problem Statement
#### Predict lung cancer risk level using patient health and lifestyle factors AND explain why the model made that prediction.

### Dataset: [Cancer Patients and Air Pollution Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/cancer-patients-and-air-pollution-a-new-link/data)


### Implementing a fuzzy set logic for human interpretability
